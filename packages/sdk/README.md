## Creating a Plugin

Check out our [1st party plugins](https://github.com/Nick-Lucas/dataden-plugins) for complete examples of using the SDK, but in short a few things are required:

* Your entry file exports `createPlugin(...)` as default
* Your package.json defines a `main` field pointing at your entry file
* Your plugin is published on NPM if you want to contribute it to our plugin registry for others to use
* **Important:** It is _highly_ recommended that you use the package.json `files` property to whitelist your `dist/` directory and nothing else for publishing. Don't accidentally publish your `.authcache.json` or `outputs/` from the emulator and leak personal data

```js
// index.ts

import { createPlugin } from '@dataden/sdk'

export default createPlugin({
  // ... implement some plugin APIs ...
})

```

While Typescript should be preferred, both `.ts` and `.js` files are also supported, so you can use plain javascript if you prefer. Types are great though!
