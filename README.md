# FAQ

#### I want to write a plugin

* Not much documentation exists for this right now. Check out:
  * The [SDK readme](packages/sdk/README.md)
  * Our [1st-party plugins make good example code](https://github.com/Nick-Lucas/dataden-plugins)

#### I want my plugin to appear in the registry

More documentation will be added on this later.

* Open a pull request which adds it to `./meta/registry.json`. 
* Please set `verified` as false as we will set this ourselves once we have tested out and trust your plugin.
